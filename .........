Video Games Sales Data Cleaning and Visualization

Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and visualizing a dataset of video game sales using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset (Video_Games_Sales_2016.csv) includes global sales data categorized by region, platform, and product details.

The project is divided into two main parts:

Data Cleaning: Removing blank cells, dropping unnecessary columns, renaming columns, and checking data integrity.
Visualization: Summarizing and visualizing global sales data for the top 10 products.
Steps Performed
1. Import Necessary Libraries
The required libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations, are imported.

2. Load the Dataset
The video games sales dataset is read using pd.read_csv() for analysis.

3. Checking Column Names
Initial inspection of the dataset using head() and tail() ensures proper data structure.

4. Calculate Specific Columns
Sales-related calculations such as sum(), count(), max(), min(), and mean() are performed on the "Global_Sales" column.

5. Remove Specific Columns
Unnecessary columns, including 'Rating', 'Developer', and 'Year_of_Release', are removed using drop().

6. Count Blank Cells
Blank cells are identified and counted using isnull().sum().

7. Remove Blanks from Specific Columns
Rows with blank cells in the "Name" column are dropped to maintain data quality.

8. Verify Blank Removal
The dataset is checked again for blank cells to confirm clean data.

9. Rename Columns
Columns like "NA_Sales", "EU_Sales", and "JP_Sales" are renamed for clarity to "North_America_sales", "European_union", and "Japan_sales", respectively.

10. Visualize Data with Labels
Top 10 products by "Global_Sales" are visualized using a bar chart. Product names are plotted on the x-axis, and their respective sales values on the y-axis. Data labels are added to provide clarity.

Visualization Highlights
The final bar chart displays the top 10 products by global sales, with data labels to indicate exact sales figures.
